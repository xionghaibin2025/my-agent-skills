# InstSci Publisher PDF Workflow

This reference is for InstSci publisher PDF retrieval, closed-access verification, publisher capability matrices, and DOI batch recovery tasks.

## Decision Ladder

1. Classify the request.
   - Metadata search, DOI normalization, OA lookup, and route discovery can use normal HTTP tools.
   - Publisher PDF download, closed-access verification, final publisher support verdicts, and capability matrices require visible CloakBrowser evidence.
2. Load policy before identity decisions.
   - Read `instsci/data/institutional_identity_policy.json` from the repository root or run `instsci identity-policy`.
3. Choose identity route.
   - Prefer explicit `--institution`.
   - Then use configured `carsi_idp_name`.
   - Then use configured `school`.
   - If none exists, ask for the user's subscription institution.
4. Use least-surprising access.
   - Prefer publisher broker, Shibboleth, OpenAthens, CARSI, and configured WAYFless links.
   - Use WebVPN only for configured institutions with browser-verified WebVPN routes.
   - If WebVPN fails, try the publisher article-page institutional login flow before marking failure.
5. Preserve visible browser context.
   - Reuse `browser_profile_dir`, `carsi_cookie_dir/<publisher>.json`, and `attempt_cache` when available.
   - Do not hide CloakBrowser while the user may need to complete SSO, 2FA, CAPTCHA, or WAF checks.
6. Verify visually.
   - Screenshots are required after important UI actions.
   - DOM events, URLs, logs, and cookies are supporting evidence only.

## MCP And Skill Handoff

- Let the skill decide whether a task is metadata/OA work, HTTP preflight, or final publisher PDF evidence.
- Use MCP tools for structured context first: `get_institutional_identity_policy`, `get_publisher_access_catalog`, and `get_publisher_browser_verification_matrix`.
- Use `plan_publisher_pdf_workflow` to produce the visible CLI command and to detect missing subscription institution context.
- Do not use MCP `fetch_paper`, HTTP probes, cookie replay, or direct request results as final closed-access publisher PDF verdicts.
- Once a task needs final PDF evidence, start or resume `instsci papers` / `instsci publisher-batch` and keep the CloakBrowser visible for user login and visual checkpoints.
- If MCP context differs from `AGENTS.md` or `instsci/data/*.json`, prefer the repository files and report the mismatch.

## Recent Gotchas

- Elsevier institution entry must not click `Go to Elsevier Homepage` while trying to select an institution.
- Elsevier Tsinghua ShibAuth/WAYFless can bypass unstable organization search when the user explicitly selected or configured Tsinghua.
- Elsevier article pages may stall on a visible `Access through your organization` button even while the CLI process is alive. If browser automation does not advance, inspect the visible CloakBrowser window and click the public institution-access control.
- ScienceDirect may show a Chrome PDF viewer while automated download capture times out. Label this as viewer/download-capture failure with screenshot evidence, not as publisher unsupported.
- When the ScienceDirect PDF viewer displays `PDF loaded` but the Playwright download event is still waiting, use the viewer toolbar `Download` button as a browser-verified fallback; this can let `publisher-batch` capture the download event and save the PDF.
- If `publisher-batch` has already written `summary.json` with `pdf_not_captured` and the Python process has exited, clicking the still-open viewer's `Download` button will not be captured by InstSci. Start a new short single-DOI run with the same browser profile, then click `Download` while that listener is alive.
- ScienceDirect may return `CPE00001 / There was a problem providing the content you requested`; report the exact blocker and screenshot path.
- ACS has worked with explicit English institution name such as `Tsinghua University`; do not generalize that into a default institution.
- Wiley institutional login, full-text entry, and PDF entry paths have had recent fixes; verify with visible browser evidence before changing status.
- `accept_downloads=True` is required in the built-in browser context for reliable Playwright download capture.
- Browser PDF viewer toolbar download fallback can matter when publisher PDF links open in a viewer instead of triggering a direct download.

## Visible UI Fallback

Use this only for the already visible InstSci CloakBrowser window when normal browser automation stalls. Prefer text-visible controls over raw coordinates. Do not use this to enter account passwords, OTPs, or other credentials. CAPTCHA or Cloudflare checkbox clicks require explicit user confirmation, or the user should click them manually.

Typical sequence for Elsevier:

1. Confirm the `publisher-batch` process is still alive and the window title belongs to the target article or Elsevier page.
2. Use UI Automation to click public controls:
   - `Access through your organization`
   - institution search input such as `Organization name or email`
   - the user-selected institution result, for example `Tsinghua University` only when that institution was explicitly selected for this run
   - `Submit and continue`
   - Chrome PDF viewer toolbar `Download`
3. Hand off to the user for institution account login, password, 2FA, and CAPTCHA unless the user explicitly confirms a CAPTCHA checkbox click.
4. After the user completes verification, continue watching the run directory for `summary_partial.json`, `attempts.jsonl`, and `primary/pdfs/*.pdf`.

PowerShell patterns that worked on Windows:

```powershell
Add-Type -AssemblyName UIAutomationClient
Add-Type -AssemblyName UIAutomationTypes
$p = Get-Process chrome | Where-Object { $_.Path -match 'cloakbrowser' -and $_.MainWindowTitle -match 'ScienceDirect|Chromium|Find your organization' } | Select-Object -First 1
$w = [System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement]::FromHandle($p.MainWindowHandle)
$all = $w.FindAll([System.Windows.Automation.TreeScope]::Descendants, [System.Windows.Automation.Condition]::TrueCondition)
```

Find by visible text and invoke:

```powershell
$target = $null
for ($i = 0; $i -lt $all.Count; $i++) {
  $e = $all.Item($i)
  if ([string]$e.Current.Name -eq 'Access through your organization' -and $e.Current.IsEnabled) {
    $target = $e
    break
  }
}
$target.GetCurrentPattern([System.Windows.Automation.InvokePattern]::Pattern).Invoke()
```

For institution search boxes exposed as `ComboBox`, set text through `ValuePattern`:

```powershell
$comboCond = New-Object System.Windows.Automation.PropertyCondition(
  [System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement]::ControlTypeProperty,
  [System.Windows.Automation.ControlType]::ComboBox
)
$combo = $w.FindFirst([System.Windows.Automation.TreeScope]::Descendants, $comboCond)
$combo.GetCurrentPattern([System.Windows.Automation.ValuePattern]::Pattern).SetValue('Tsinghua University')
```

Do not fall back to hard-coded coordinates until text-based UIA has failed. If coordinates are necessary, first read the window bounds and take a visual checkpoint.

## Windows Page-Control Playbook

Use this when the visible CloakBrowser is on the right page but the normal Playwright/CloakBrowser automation is stalled, or when the user asks not to use Computer Use. UI Automation is suitable for public page controls and browser chrome controls; do not use it to enter passwords, OTPs, recovery codes, or other account secrets.

Workflow:

1. Find the real CloakBrowser window by process path and title.
   - Prefer `Get-Process chrome | Where-Object { $_.Path -match 'cloakbrowser' -and $_.MainWindowTitle }`.
   - If the target title is missing, enumerate all CloakBrowser windows before deciding the browser closed.
2. Restore and foreground the window before reading controls.
   - `Bounds=Empty` usually means minimized, hidden, or not foregroundable yet.
   - Use `ShowWindowAsync(..., 9)` and `SetForegroundWindow(...)`, then wait briefly.
3. Enumerate descendants and inspect names, types, enabled state, and bounds.
   - Capture a compact table before clicking when the page state is uncertain.
   - Match by visible `Name`, `ControlType`, and `IsEnabled`; prefer this over DOM guesses when the browser automation has stalled.
4. Operate by UIA pattern.
   - Buttons: `InvokePattern`.
   - Search boxes / comboboxes: `ValuePattern.SetValue(...)`.
   - If a combo result appears, enumerate list items and invoke the exact user-selected institution result.
5. Re-read page state after each click.
   - A successful click should change visible controls, title, loaded-PDF markers, run logs, or output files.
   - Do not conclude from click success alone.
6. Keep the InstSci listener state in mind.
   - UIA can click a viewer download button, but `publisher-batch` only captures the file if the Python listener is still waiting for a download event.

Window restore helper:

```powershell
Add-Type @'
using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
public class Win32Show {
  [DllImport("user32.dll")] public static extern bool ShowWindowAsync(IntPtr hWnd, int nCmdShow);
  [DllImport("user32.dll")] public static extern bool SetForegroundWindow(IntPtr hWnd);
}
'@
$p = Get-Process chrome | Where-Object { $_.Path -match 'cloakbrowser' -and $_.MainWindowTitle -match 'ScienceDirect|Chromium' } | Select-Object -First 1
[Win32Show]::ShowWindowAsync($p.MainWindowHandle, 9) | Out-Null
[Win32Show]::SetForegroundWindow($p.MainWindowHandle) | Out-Null
Start-Sleep -Milliseconds 700
```

Control inventory helper:

```powershell
Add-Type -AssemblyName UIAutomationClient
Add-Type -AssemblyName UIAutomationTypes
$w = [System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement]::FromHandle($p.MainWindowHandle)
$all = $w.FindAll([System.Windows.Automation.TreeScope]::Descendants, [System.Windows.Automation.Condition]::TrueCondition)
$rows = @()
for ($i = 0; $i -lt $all.Count; $i++) {
  $e = $all.Item($i)
  $n = [string]$e.Current.Name
  if ($n -match 'Access|organization|Institution|PDF|Download|Sign|ScienceDirect|Tsinghua') {
    $rows += [pscustomobject]@{
      Index = $i
      Name = $n
      Type = $e.Current.ControlType.ProgrammaticName
      Enabled = $e.Current.IsEnabled
      Bounds = $e.Current.BoundingRectangle.ToString()
    }
  }
}
$rows | Format-Table -AutoSize
```

Localized labels can be built with `[char]` codes to avoid mojibake in non-UTF-8 consoles. For example, the Chinese `Download` label in Chrome PDF viewer is:

```powershell
$downloadLabel = -join ([char]0x4e0b, [char]0x8f7d)
```

## Already At PDF Viewer

When the user says the visible CloakBrowser is already on the PDF page, preserve that state and recover the file without closing the browser.

1. Check whether the InstSci listener is still alive.
   - Look for the `python -m instsci.cli publisher-batch ...` process for that run.
   - If `primary/summary.json` or `attempts.jsonl` already says `pdf_not_captured` and no Python process remains, the listener is gone.
2. If the listener is alive, use UIA to click the PDF viewer localized `Download` button after visual/UIA evidence shows the PDF is loaded.
3. If the listener is gone, start a fresh single-DOI run with the same institution/profile and a new output directory, then click `Download` while it is waiting.
4. Confirm success from `primary/pdfs/*.pdf`, `complete/pdfs/*.pdf`, `attempts.jsonl`, and `primary/summary_partial.json`; require `status=success`, nonzero size, and preferably `verified_match=true`.

PowerShell launch pattern for a fresh single-DOI listener:

```powershell
$doiFile = ".\.tmp\one_doi.txt"
$out = ".\runs\browser_runs_resume\elsevier_retry_YYYYMMDD"
$argString = '-m instsci.cli publisher-batch "' + $doiFile + '" --publisher elsevier --institution "Institution Name" --output "' + $out + '" --login-timeout 600 --pdf-timeout 900'
Start-Process -FilePath "python" -ArgumentList $argString -WorkingDirectory (Get-Location) -RedirectStandardOutput "$out\publisher-batch.stdout.log" -RedirectStandardError "$out\publisher-batch.stderr.log" -WindowStyle Hidden
```

Quote institution names inside the argument string; passing `@(..., "Tsinghua University", ...)` to `Start-Process -ArgumentList` can split the institution into two CLI arguments.

UIA loop for the PDF viewer download button:

```powershell
Add-Type -AssemblyName UIAutomationClient
Add-Type -AssemblyName UIAutomationTypes
$p = Get-Process chrome | Where-Object { $_.Path -match 'cloakbrowser' -and $_.MainWindowTitle -match 'Simulation-Based|ScienceDirect|Applied Energy|Chromium' } | Select-Object -First 1
$w = [System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement]::FromHandle($p.MainWindowHandle)
$all = $w.FindAll([System.Windows.Automation.TreeScope]::Descendants, [System.Windows.Automation.Condition]::TrueCondition)
$hasPdf = $false
$target = $null
$downloadLabel = -join ([char]0x4e0b, [char]0x8f7d)
$pdfLoadedLabel = "PDF " + (-join ([char]0x5df2, [char]0x52a0, [char]0x8f7d, [char]0x5b8c, [char]0x6bd5))
$pageContentMarker = -join ([char]0x9875, [char]0x5185, [char]0x5bb9)
for ($i = 0; $i -lt $all.Count; $i++) {
  $e = $all.Item($i)
  $n = [string]$e.Current.Name
  if ($n -eq $pdfLoadedLabel -or $n -match 'PDF loaded' -or ($n -match 'PDF' -and $n.Contains($pageContentMarker))) { $hasPdf = $true }
  if (-not $target -and $n -in @($downloadLabel, 'Download') -and $e.Current.IsEnabled) { $target = $e }
}
if ($hasPdf -and $target) {
  $target.GetCurrentPattern([System.Windows.Automation.InvokePattern]::Pattern).Invoke()
}
```

The `[char]` expressions avoid mojibake when the Markdown is read through a non-UTF-8 PowerShell console.

After recovery, update the final delivery layer, not only the run folder:

- copy the verified PDF into `final_pdfs` using the existing naming convention;
- update `reports/final_manifest.csv`;
- update `reports/final_manifest.json` without changing its current top-level shape;
- update `reports/final_report.md` counts. On Windows, write Markdown with UTF-8 BOM if PowerShell needs to display Chinese paths correctly.

## Command Patterns

Run from the repository root.

```powershell
instsci identity-policy
instsci papers .\dois.txt --publisher auto --institution "Institution Name" --output .\runs\papers
instsci publisher-batch .\dois.txt --publisher elsevier --institution "Institution Name" --output .\runs\elsevier
python -m unittest tests.test_acs_batch
git diff --check
```

If R is needed in this repo, use:

```powershell
& "D:\Program Files\R\R-4.5.3\bin\Rscript.exe" script.R
```

## Report Template

Use this structure for each DOI or publisher:

```text
publisher:
doi:
route_attempted:
institution:
result:
evidence:
next_action:
```

Allowed `result` labels:

- `browser verified`
- `HTTP preflight`
- `auth_required`
- `blocked`
- `unsupported`

Do not mark `unsupported`, `failed`, or `verified` from HTTP-only evidence.

## Manifest Consistency

Keep `final_report.md`, `final_manifest.csv`, and `final_manifest.json` aligned.

- `success`: PDF exists and verification passed.
- `unverified`: PDF exists but DOI/text verification did not pass or was inconclusive.
- `missing`: no final PDF was captured.

When a PDF is present but automation cannot prove DOI/text match, do not count it as missing.

## Security And State

- Do not write tokens, MCP endpoints, cookies, exported credentials, SSO screenshots with sensitive fields, or institutional secrets into skill files, docs, logs, or commits.
- Cookie jars are not full browser login state. Full state may include localStorage, IndexedDB, service workers, cache, TLS sessions, WAF challenge state, browser fingerprint state, and page-generated PDF tokens.
- Keep live CloakBrowser context open while it is serving as the active access broker.
- Do not manually call Xiaozhi notification scripts; task status notification is handled elsewhere.

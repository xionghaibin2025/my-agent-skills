# Geospatial figure workflow

Use this reference whenever a figure contains rasters, vector boundaries,
geographic coordinates, map projections, or spatial distributions.

## 1. Inspect the source

Before plotting, confirm:

- source CRS and datum;
- coordinate units;
- raster bounds and affine transform;
- spatial resolution and grid orientation;
- NoData value or mask;
- whether coordinates describe pixel centers or pixel edges.

Do not assume that missing CRS metadata represent EPSG:4326.

## 2. Prepare the display coordinates

Use EPSG:4326 as the default plotting CRS. If the source CRS is not EPSG:4326,
prefer an in-memory display-only representation in EPSG:4326. If an on-disk
temporary representation is unavoidable, create it outside the formal
deliverable set in a task-specific temporary location and remove only the
temporary files created by the current task after verification.

Do not overwrite the source data. Do not use the display representation for
area, distance, zonal statistics, trend analysis, or other scientific
calculations.

A display-only CRS conversion may remain in the plotting script. A CRS
transformation used by scientific analysis belongs in the processing script.

The preprocessing stage owns source CRS, coordinate, filter, and analytical
transformation validation. The plotting stage should check only the final fields
and coordinate invariants needed to render the map. Do not repeat complete source
provenance or analytical checks in the plotting script.

## 3. Plot with UltraPlot

Create a geographic axes using `proj="pcarree"`. Plot EPSG:4326 coordinates
and format longitude and latitude labels in degrees.

```python
import cartopy.crs as ccrs
import ultraplot as uplt

fig, ax = uplt.subplots(proj="pcarree", journal="nat2")
m = ax.pcolormesh(
    lon,
    lat,
    data,
    transform=ccrs.PlateCarree(),
    cmap="batlow",
)
ax.format(lonlabels="b", latlabels="l", grid=True)
ax.colorbar(m, loc="r", label="value")
```

`grid=True` or `grid=False` controls whether geographic gridlines are shown.
Select label sides, locators, and formatters for the scientific message, but
inherit the effective UltraPlot gridline and geographic-label appearance by
default. Omit `gridcolor`, `gridalpha`, `gridlinewidth`, `gridlinestyle`,
`labelcolor`, and `gridlabelcolor` unless an override is explicitly justified.
Do not hard-code UltraPlot's current default values. Because rc aliases and
meta-settings can couple line and label properties, inspect gridline strokes
and longitude and latitude labels separately after any justified override.

Do not specify a universal interpolation or raster-resampling method in this
skill. Let the plotting implementation choose an appropriate behavior for the
particular figure.

## 4. Verify the map

Confirm that:

- longitude and latitude labels use degree notation;
- the displayed extent matches the source study area;
- raster orientation is correct;
- administrative boundaries and rasters align;
- NoData areas are not assigned scientific colors;
- no source or analytical dataset was overwritten;
- no display-only temporary dataset remains in the formal deliverable set;
- the rendered output was visually inspected.
